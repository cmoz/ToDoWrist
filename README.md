ESP32 and ePaper make a powerhouse of a wearable project! 

This code was written in PlatformIO so it also has the ini file for settings if you are using an ESP32 C3 super mini board. Alter this file to suit your project settings.

You can copy the code from the main.cpp file and paste into the Arduino IDE and the code will run. BUT you MUST download all the included libraries to have this code function.

Edit the HTML parts of the file to alter how the pages are displayed in the browser or phone.
